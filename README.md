# Eink family calendar

## What is it?
I needed to have an updatable calendar to keep track of my children's school agenda,
as well as some post-school activities. So instead of using a whiteboard, I thought
it would be a nice holiday project to do it with a Raspberry Pi 2 and an e-ink
screen.

## What do you need
- A Raspberry Pi (any model would do, I did it with a Pi 2), with the Raspberry Pi OS.
- Eink display: [640x384, 7.5inch E-Ink display HAT for Raspberry Pi, yellow/black/white three-color](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/7.5inch-e-paper-hat-c.htm).
- A [1x4 matrix keypad](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1332) to allow you to switch
  between the different calendars. There are multiple clones in different shops.
- A photo frame to house the setup. I bought one at a local shop, just make sure it has
  enough depth to host all the hardware.
- One or more Caldav calendars to display.

## Configuring
Once the basic setup and connections are done (TODO: add diagram for GPIO connections),
you will need to set up the `config.ini` file. This is the syntax:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
video = pygame
keyboard = pygame

[weather]
owm_api_key = <insert API key here>
owm_location = <insert location id here>

[calendar]
urls = http://example.com/caldavcal1, http://example.com/caldavcal2, http://example.com/caldavcal3
names = user1, user2, user3
username = user
password = password
```

### Driver configuration
We have two different drivers to be used for both video output and keyboard input.
This allows us to hack and tests locally without using the e-ink screen all the time.

- For video, we can use `pygame` for the [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame)
  driver, or `eink` to use the e-ink screen.
- For keyboard input, we can use `pygame` to get input from your computer's keyboard,
  or `gpio` to use the 1x4 keypad connected to the GPIO pins 29 ,31, 33, 35 and 37.

### Open Weather Map API configuration
You need to subscribe to the "Current Weather Data" API [link](https://openweathermap.org/api).
Note that you need to sign in as a user (it's free). Once you get the API key and the
location id for your town, add them to the `owm_api_key` and `owm_location` keys in
the configuration file.

### Calendar configuration
You can use any CalDav link; in my case, I set up 3 calendars in a [Synology](https://www.synology.com)
DiskStation. The code should adapt to any number of calendars, but keep in mind the
resolution and font size ;).

The `urls` parameter is a comma-separated list of CalDav urls. Since each of those
calendars will correspond to an actual person, `names` will contain the list of
names for each url. Make sure you spefify the same number of urls and names.

The `username` and `password` fields are self-explaining: include the user and
password to access the calendars.

If you want to use a different type of calendar, such as Google Calendar, you
will need to create a new driver. Patches are welcome :).

## Running
The scripts directory contains a simple launcher script using a virtual environment,
and a systemd unit file you can use to ensure the program runs on startup.

When the application is stopped, it should clear the e-ink display, which is a good
idea to avoid displa burnout. In some cases, it may not happen (for example if
you get a power disruption). You can use the `reset_eink.py` script in those
cases to clear the screen.

## Usage
When started, the calendar will show today's calendar for everyone, from 8:00 to
21:00 (times are not configurable at the moment). You can switch to a weekly, Monday-to-Friday
calendar for each person by pressing the 2, 3 or 4 buttons in the keypad, and
switch back to the daily calendar by pressing 1. Yes, that means that having
more than 3 calendars could require code changes ;).

After 9 PM, the calendar will enter in screensaver mode, and display the image
in the `img/night_image.jpg` file. The image will be converted to a 1-bit format,
so it's better if you use a 1-bit image already.

If there is a JPG or PNG file named after today's date, in DD-MM-YYYY format
(for example, 01-01-2022.png for January 1st, 2022), the screensaver will use that
image instead of the default one. Be creative!

but if it can be helpful to anyone, I'd be more than happy to improve it and
its documentation.
